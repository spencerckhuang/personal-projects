# GPA Calculator
## Author: Spencer Huang

### What is this?
This is a project made to take an input text file containing__
information about one's classes, outputting the student's GPA__
and information about whether they made the honor roll for that__
semester. In the input file, information about each class is__
stored line-by-line, and contains the class name, the number__
of credits it is worth, and the grade received in the class.__

### Methodology
The highlight feature of this project is the use of C++ classes.__
I created a class called 'Course' to store the information about__
a single course. It features getters and setters to retrieve __
and update course information. 

Another structural highlight involves the use of a header file__
and another cpp file to keep my main file as short as possible.__

Lastly, since this is my first independent project written with__
Git knowledge, this is also my first time writing a README file__
with Git-flavored markup.__

### Inspiration
I made this project for two reasons. Firstly, I have just learned__
about object-oriented C++, and wanted to try to create something__
using what I had learned. However, I felt compelled to create a__
GPA calculator today since I took a Calculus exam this morning__
and it was a lot harder than I anticipated. Worried about my__
GPA, I decided to code a GPA calculator so I could see how my__
GPA would look depending on my Calculus grade.__

### Updates
Nov. 4: Started and finished working version that prints out__
    GPA and whether the student has made the Dean's List or not.__
