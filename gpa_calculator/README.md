# GPA Calculator
## Author: Spencer Huang

### What is this?
This is a project made to take an input text file containing
information about one's classes, outputting the student's GPA
and information about whether they made the honor roll for that
semester. In the input file, information about each class is
stored line-by-line, and contains the class name, the number
of credits it is worth, and the grade received in the class.

### Methodology
The highlight feature of this project is the use of C++ classes.
I created a class called 'Course' to store the information about
a single course. It features getters and setters to retrieve 
and update course information. 

Another structural highlight involves the use of a header file
and another cpp file to keep my main file as short as possible.

Lastly, since this is my first independent project written with
Git knowledge, this is also my first time writing a README file
with Git-flavored markup.__

### Inspiration
I made this project for two reasons. Firstly, I have just learned
about object-oriented C++, and wanted to try to create something
using what I had learned. However, I felt compelled to create a
GPA calculator today since I took a Calculus exam this morning
and it was a lot harder than I anticipated. Worried about my
GPA, I decided to code a GPA calculator so I could see how my
GPA would look depending on my Calculus grade.

### Updates
Nov. 4: Started and finished working version that prints out__
    GPA and whether the student has made the Dean's List or not.__
